# Responsive Restaurant Review App

## Project Overview: Stage 1

Responsive Restaurant Review App is a project required to complete Udacity Front-End Development Nano Degree. The goal of the project is to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application, make it accessible for screen reader use and add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

## Mapbox:

To load the map, you will need a [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) key. You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.

Then, to run the application, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.

When the application is opened, users can see a map with markers, pointing to restaurants located in various neighborhoods of NYC. Using a dropdown menu, users can choose a particular neighbourhood or cuisine. A list of restaurants available are shown in the area under the map. To get more information, opening hours and reviews, users can click on "View Details".
